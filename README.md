## Project Overview

#### This project is an application designed to manage patient records within the medical system. It allows for the addition and deletion of patient information, and enables administrators to securely access and transfer this data.

## Features Tested
### The following user stories are tested in this project:

### 1- **Checking Login Errors System - (US_401)**

#### Users are responsible for their actions. Implementing a warning message for incorrect login attempts would enhance security.

### 2- **Login Positive - (US_402)**

#### Users, access to the system is desired to take advantage of the application's features.

### 3- **LogOut - (US_403)**

#### Users, secure logout from the system is desired to ensure that the application is not left open.

### 4- **Patient Registration- (US_404)**

#### Users, the ability to enter information and register patients in the system is essential. This way, there is no need for another application when patient information is required.

### 5- **My Account- (US_405)**

#### Users, there should be an icon or link on the homepage that provides access to account settings. This way, users can quickly reach their account-related configurations.

### 6- **Search the Patient List - (US_406)**

#### As a doctor, the ability to list patients, search for a specific patient by name or ID, and access their information is important for providing treatment.

### 7- **Patient Deletion - (US_407)** 

#### As a doctor, the ability to delete a patient from the system is necessary to protect the confidentiality of their information.

### 8- **Patient List- (US_408)**

#### As a doctor, the ability to list all patients is essential for more effective planning.

### 8- **Patient Merge- (US_409)**

#### As a doctor, the ability to merge any two patient records previously entered is important for facilitating easier prescription management.

### 8- **Wrong Time Zone- (US_410)**

#### Users, the ability to see an error message when the system clock is set to a time outside of GMT+0 while creating a patient appointment is essential.
